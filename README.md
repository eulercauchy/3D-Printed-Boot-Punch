# 3D-Printed-Boot-Punch
A 3D model for a 3D printed boot punch in OpenSCAD.

Just modify the clamplength and clampwidth to fit your face clamp ends.  Print, heat up your ski/skate boot with a heatgun or hairdryer (if you have a long time). Clamp ball end on where you want to push out from the inside of the boot, wait until cool.  Enjoy your new pressure point free boot.  Works with PLA, just melts and deforms a little bit, I would use 100% infill next time, but 70% worked fine.

This works with OpenSCAD.
